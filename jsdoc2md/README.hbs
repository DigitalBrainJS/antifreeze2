:star: Define feature-rich properties using decorators or plain functions. An extended version of Object.defineProperty :star:

# Why
If you have a heavy synchronous task, you may use workers or just split the task to several async micro tasks/chunks
to keep event loop always running, its pretty easy to do that with async function.
But async function doesn't guarantee that all of its task scheduled by await will be executed really asynchronously
and will not block the IO stage of the EventLoop. This simple package consists some helpers to ensure that the event loop
is running, measuring the duration of the current event tick and allowing it go to the next tick if the maximum tick duration is exceeded.

``` bash
$ npm install antifreeze2 --save
