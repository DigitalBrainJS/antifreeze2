:star: Antifreeze for eventloop- let it always work :star:

# Why
If you have a heavy synchronous task, you may use workers or just split the task to several async micro tasks/chunks
to keep event loop always running, its pretty easy to do that with async function.
But async function doesn't guarantee that all of its task scheduled by await will be executed really asynchronously
and will not block the IO stage of the EventLoop. This simple package consists some helpers to ensure that the event loop
is running, measuring the duration of the current event tick and allowing it go to the next tick if the maximum tick duration is exceeded.


## Installation

Install for node.js using npm/yarn:

``` bash
$ npm install antifreeze2 --save
```

``` bash
$ yarn add antifreeze2
```

````javascript
const { antifreeze, isNeeded, watchTick }= require('antifreeze2');
````

## Usage examples
#### Example 1 - Fibonacci
For example, we need to calculate Fibonacci for 1,000,000 value.
It's a task with heavy computation since it can take around 10s to complete.
If we write the function as synchronous or just use an ECMA asynchronous function, the event loop will be blocked for that period.
We won't be able to perform other tasks like accepting new connections, I/O events, timers, etc. because we only have one thread.
To avoid this, we must ensure that the event loop tick duration does not exceed the allowed range of 15-20ms in order for the application to remain responsive.

By default, the desired event loop tick is set to **10ms**. You can change it using `watchTick(maxTick: number)` function.
[See online demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/antifreeze2-basic-example-ulsvq?file=/src/index.js)
```js
import {antifreeze, isNeeded} from "antifreeze2";

// A function with heavy computations
const fibAsync = async(n) => {
  let a = 1n, b = 1n, sum, i = n - 2;
  while (i-- > 0) {
    sum = a + b;
    a = b;
    b = sum;
    if (isNeeded()) {      // If more than 10ms have passed since the last run of the eventloop cycle
      await antifreeze();  // let the event loop get polled
    }
  }
  return b;
};

// Test it - calculate Fibonacci for n= 1,000,000
(async (n) => {
  let ts = Date.now();
  let ticks = 0;

  const timer = setInterval(() => {
    const now = Date.now();
    console.log(`Timer tick [${now - ts}ms]`);
    ts = now;
    ticks++;
  }, 100);

  const result = await fibAsync(n);

  console.warn(`\nTimer ticks: ${ticks}\nFibonacci(${n}) = ${result}`)

  clearTimeout(timer);
})(500000);
```

Optionally, to get the maximum performance, you can throttle the `isNeeded()` call by using some counter:

```js
const fibAsync = async(n) => {
  let a = 1n, b = 1n, sum, i = n - 2;
  while (i-- > 0) {
    sum = a + b;
    a = b;
    b = sum;
    // check only every 1000th cycle
    if (!(i % 1000) && isNeeded()) {      // If more than 10ms have passed since the last run of the eventloop cycle
      await antifreeze();  // let the event loop get polled
    }
  }
  return b;
};
```

#### Example 2 - koa server with heavy computation

[See online demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/festive-pine-fwehi?file=/src/index.js)

The application has two endpoints:

[Time request](https://fwehi.sse.codesandbox.io/time) - light query with 20ms latency

[Fibonacci request](https://fwehi.sse.codesandbox.io/fibonacci/1000000) - heavy query that takes 10s to complete

Note that while a heavy request is being executed, the server continues to process light requests even though it is only running in one thread.
